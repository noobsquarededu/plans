## first of all welcome to our world
- the world in which we  care about data structures more than we care about you.

## target:
- master data structures (know when to use what).
- solve more and more problems.
- get ready for a heavy algorithms course.

## style:

### **the style we will follow is to divide our target into weeks and each week into small easy steps.**

## approach:

- I will not explain everything (am just here to support you with learning resources and mentorship -> tutorials are everywhere).
- I expect you to do your best as data structures are hard to master.
- I expect you to solve and follow the plan without any shortcuts -> just trust the process.
- do not forget to have fun.
